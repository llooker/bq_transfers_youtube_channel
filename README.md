### Block Info

_This Block is modeled on the schema brough in by Google's BigQuery Transfer Service. It will cover many of the core entities involved with the AdWords offering. Depending on how you use the DFP service, you may have additional entities brought in through thge BQ Transfer Service, especially any custom built reports. This Block should serve as a great jump start. Happy modeling!_

_The schema documentation for YouTube can be found in [Google's docs](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/). Please note that your naming might vary slightly._
